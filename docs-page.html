								checkboxes you can check.</p>
							<h6>Some specific interfaces include:</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The Search box at the top of the Home View: This allows you to search for a question
									by
									keyword. This search will find keywords
									that appear in both the question and answer text. It will automatically begin
									searching as soon as you begin typing.
									In order to return to the unfiltered question bank, the search bar must be blank. I
									have included a clear button that appears whenever
									there is text in the field.
								</li>
								<li>
									The single option dropdown boxes: These dropdowns will only allow you to choose one
									option, and these are in place in situations
									where it would only make sense to be able to choose one option. You simply click the
									downward facing chevron, highlight your option, and click.
								</li>
								<li>
									The multi-select list box: This particular feature only appears in the Exam Designer
									page. It allows you to make multiple selections and filter the
									generated exams by the given selections.
								</li>
								<li>
									The two methods by which you can delete questions are both protected by a familiar
									"Are you sure?" popup. That is, whether you are
									utilizing the "Select and Batch Delete" or "Deleting a Single Question" utilities,
									you will be confronted by a popup and a big red "Yes I am sure" button. Once you
									press
									the big red button, you questions are deleted, forever. But that's okay, one would
									be hard-pressed
									to do it by accident. And, in the case of this happening, I have my ways of getting
									the info back ;)

										<div class="card-body">
											The Pseudorandom method of generating provides the user
											with as random of an exam as possible given a few constraints.
											<ul>
												<li>
													Bank Size: Obviously, the exam bank is finite, and therefore the
													results of the pseudorandom algorithm can only be so random.
												</li>
												<li>
													Computers cannot be "Random": The limitations of the technology that
													we are using is another constraint. Without venturing into
													quantum physics, it is impossible to ask a computer to be random.
													Hence "pseudo" random, behind the scenes is an algorithm that does
													its best to simulate what humans generally perceive as random.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p> How it works (in general)
												<code>
													<pre>
While (Number of questions already selected is less than the number of questions desired) { 
	Generate a random number between 1 and n: 
		Pull the question whose ID you just randomly generated:
			if
			(
			This question is not already in the exam AND 
			This question is at the chosen CET Level OR  below if more than 50% of the exam has been created AND
			This question is the correct category if a learning objective was selected AND
			The question wasn’t used on the previous exam OR more than 50% of the exam has already been created
			)
			then (add the question to the exam)	
}

<samp><i>Where n is the total number of question in the exam bank.</samp></i>
</pre></code>
											</p>
											<p>Some of the reasoning behind this algorithm is as follows</p>
											<ol>
												<li>
													To ensure that each exam generated (given a couple of assumptions)
													is a requisite amount unique from any recently
													generated exams.
												</li>
												<li>
													In compliance with Microsoft guidance, the different levels of exam
													are 50% unique from the previous level
													by ensuring at least half the exam is at the appropriate CET level.
												</li>
												<li>
													To allow the user to generate an exam filtered by Learning
													Objective, if desired.
												</li>
												<li>
													To ensure that the exam is at or below than the level of
													certification it represents.
												</li>
											</ol>
											<p>
												The aforementioned assumptions were built in to make the "recently used"
												flag meaningful. Specifically,
												the flag on a question will only change to a value of true when the
												Download button is pressed.
												This is as opposed to every single time the generate exam button is
												pressed.
											</p>
											<h6>
												Those assumptions are all in the case of a Pseudorandom exam as the
												recently used flag is ignored for a Seeded exam, and they are as
												follows:
											</h6>
											<ul>
												<li>
													The user will only be pressing the Download button when they are
													satisfied with the exam that has been generated.
													This is why there is a preview window. It allows you to explore your
													options.
												</li>
												<li>
													That the download button will only be pressed at expected intervals.
													That is to say, exams will be needed in a predictable way, such as
													an individual's certification exams or biennial requalification
													exams.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												With the design of this algorithm and these principles in mind, the
												Pseudorandom exam is the preferred method of generation.

									<div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne"

										<div class="card-body">
											<p>The Seeded exam is much more simple, much less random, and designed such
												that given the same number of questions, same CET Level, and same
												Learning Objectives
												the exam will be the same.</p>
											<p>
												This does rely on some other nuances. As the exam bank grows and
												changes, the Seeded exams will change. Without a more complicated
												seeding or hashing algorithm, I cannot prevent this <small>(though, that
													does sound like a fun challenge)</small>.
												So, the true purpose of the Seeded exams is to be able to pull up a
												"known" exam within a reasonable proximity to the last time you pulled
												it up.
											</p>
											<p>
												It is for this reason that the Answer Key that is generated along side
												the Seeded exams provides you with the "Exam Details," thereby allowing
												you to pull up the
												same exam later.
											</p>
											<p>
												The Seeded exams are based off of the number of desired questions and
												the number of questions in the exam bank. I did some math
												and came up with an algorithm that will reliably generate the maximum
												number of unique exams from those settings, and do so in a predictable
												way (given the above assumptions.)
											</p>
											<h5>
												Et Voila, you have exams that can be recalled based on some settings.
											</h5>
											<p>
												Allowing you to pull up the answer key to an exam you lost, or perhaps a
												"level playing field" practice exam, or a quiz that you particularly
												appreciate... The training possibilities are endless.

												Finally, you will choose any Learning Objective filters that you desire.

												have to change anything.
												Even with the margins set to something other than the defaults, your

					<h1 class="docs-heading">Philosophy</h1>
					<section>
						<p>I don't want to imply that this isn’t a conversation that still needs to happen. I simply
							want
							to share my thoughts on what a training program like this
							<i>should</i> look like.
						</p>
					</section>
					<!--//docs-intro-->
				</header>
				<section class="docs-section" id="item-6-1">
					<h2 class="section-heading">The Principles</h2>
					<p>
						It goes without saying that no training program was ever designed to NOT provide a reasonable
						level of certainty in an individual's skill level.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of us come from an industry in which the codes and credentialing are airtight, often
						written because many lives have been lost. Some of us
						come from the military, where rigorous training and compliance are paramount, or lives may be
						lost. That is how I know that we all
						understand the level of scrutiny a program like the CETTP is attempting to cultivate. So, we can
						all agree that this program should uphold all of
						us to the highest standard, especially a standard that our management can have faith in.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why I believe that we should hone the CET Training Program to reflect these beliefs. I
						believe that starts with the Question Bank, which is exactly why I
						spent a month creating this app and all the associated framework.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Microsoft standard suggests that the exam bank should have a minimum of 100 questions and
						those questions should be periodically updated.
						The Question Editor and Add New Question features are designed to make this as simple as
						possible, and though I made a joke out of it in the earlier section,
						I believe we can take this one step further. Any time a training coordinator learns something
						new or an intense discussion during quals or a drill come up, it
						should be our standard practice to put that piece of information into circulation. This is the
						first principle that I think we should adopt. The desire to
						constantly improve our understanding and level of expertise.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second principle is the logical successor to the first principle. We need to squash the
						tribal aspect of our knowledge. I have not been here for
						very long but the number of times I have heard the sentences "this is how we have always done
						it"
						or "I don’t think that is a very good idea" or "if
						we change it too many people will get confused" is too high. We need to adopt a growth mindset
						and ensure that any new or old knowledge is
						vetted and approved by the appropriate body of knowledge. Be it the documentation or the powers
						that be. That starts with updating and backing
						up all of our current knowledge with proof and (if possible) testing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another major paradigm shift that I believe would be beneficial is to hold ourselves to a much
						higher standard.
						We do not have the person-power to have the command and qualification hierarchy of larger
						facilities, and I
						am not even implying that we should have one. I do not bring this topic up because I want to
						bring people down,
						but because I want to bring everyone UP. If we are going to accept and adopt the intention
						behind Microsoft's
						data-driven, open-book policy then we should do our best to meet the intent rather than succumb
						to it.
						I suggest that we do this by limiting the resources that we can use during the test to
						what
						we would be
						okay with using during a procedure or a break-fix. We wouldn't rely on written notes or CET
						Study guides during
						a UPS failure, so why would we use them during the test. Furthermore, I believe that the
						standard by which the
						questions are written should also be higher. Not that they should take so long that you don't
						have time to think,
						or that they should be so difficult that you couldn't possibly know them without looking it up,
						but
						that they should be
						challenging enough
						to make us think and, if we don’t know the answer, know where to look it up. That being said,
						instead of
						fearing a more challenging exam, we should be constantly preparing for the exam. That way, we
						can be sure
						that those that succeed are well qualified, and those that fail can be helped in a meaningful
						way. That is
						why I included the Weekly Quiz feature.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is all I have to say about that, and if you outright disagree with my thought process, I
						would love to
						hear your take on it all. If we all work together and combine our vastly different experiences
						and skillsets,
						the whole team will be better for it. And not just us, but our replacements.

									<p>The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve is a graphical representation of the forgetting
										process. The curve demonstrates the declining rate at which information is lost
										if
										no particular effort is made to remember it.</p>

									<p>The forgetting curve was defined in 1885 by German psychologist Hermann
										Ebbinghaus
										(1850-1909) in his book Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology. He
										was
										the first psychologist who systematically studied memory and learning.
										Ebbinghaus
										recorded his findings mathematically in an attempt to discover patterns of
										forgetting and memory retention.</p>
									<div class="card bg-secondary">
										<div class="card-body" style="color:#f0f0f0;">
											But as you can see, it is a natural and well-studied phenomenon. As such it
											should be
											treated like any other optimization problem that we encounter on a daily
											basis. The maths
											behind memory management are defined and we would be remiss to not take
											advantage of that.
